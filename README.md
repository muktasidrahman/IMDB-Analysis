Topic: Analyzing Best Movies of the decade 2010-2019
Project Idea:
Our group has chosen to analyze a imdb page called the best movies in the United States released from 2010 to 2019. For our analysis, we are using the data set from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) which is an online database of information related to films, TV programs, and streaming online content, etc. But we are mainly concentrating on the top-rated movies released in the United States based on a large number of reviewers' overall opinions on the movies.
Using a large number of reviewers' opinions on the top movies from IMDb will point out where users liked or disliked the movies and offer other criticism. Our project will be able to analyze how the top-rated movies were picked through the registered members at IMDb because they are able to write reviews, and vote on the ratings on different movies.
